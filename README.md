## Installation

Download the
[latest release](https://github.com/steveruizok/finder-toolbar-shortcuts/releases),
unzip and open the folder.

In the folder, you'll find two applications:

- `Open Current Folder in Visual Studio Code.app`
- `Open Current Folder in Terminal.app`.

These apps are designed to be run from the Finder toolbar.

To add these apps to the Finder toolbar:

- Move the apps to the Applications folder.
- Open the Applications folder.
- Press and hold the Command key, then drag each app to the Finder toolbar until
  you see a green plus sign.

> **Tip:** Right click on the toolbar and click **Customize Toolbar...** to
> re-arrange or remove items.

## Usage

- In Finder, navigate to the folder you wish to open (in Terminal or Visual
  Studio Code).
- Click the `>_` shortcut to open the current folder in Terminal.
- Or Click the `</>` shortcut to open the current folder in Visual Studio Code.

⚠️ The first time you run each shortcut, you'll be asked to give permission for
certain automation tasks. If you have concerns about security, feel free to
inspect and compile your own copies from the provided scripts.
